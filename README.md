# waifu-rng
A beautiful project inspired by boredom and Mr.Terry who created TempleOS. Made by Valtok

Introduction
============

I made this so you can talk with your favourite waifu using a random number generator! Just like Terry talked with god on his TempleOS but this doesnt require you installing a operatin system. It is just a GUI, this project is almost done. it just has to be perfected and more waifus to be added

Dependencies
============

Just make sure you have python 3 and tkinter.

Installation
===========

# Linux
Just download the source code directly and extract the stuff in the zip file. Or if you wanna be a k00l hackerman run the following command in the terminal:
`git clone https://github.com/ValtokIsHere/waifu-rng.git`

# Windows

Just download the damn source code directly and extract it on your desktop, im pretty sure you cant be k00l hackerman on windows.

# Mac

Download the source code directly and extract it on your desktop.

# Other

***Just fucking download the source code and place it on your damn desktop, if you have one.***

Usage
=====
I promise you a pretty buggy experience!

# Linux(Ubuntu,Debian)

Just put the source code on your desktop, And run the following commands in the terminal:

`cd Desktop`

`cd waifurng`

`python3.x waifu.py`

***Don't write python3.x, instead of x input your python version. Example:*** `python3.8 RNG.py`

# Windows

**This is a workaround** You can download a python IDE and run the project in it. I recommend pycharm.
